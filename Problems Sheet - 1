1) Make a array and use of  function and give me the result of all even indes in the array . In the funtion array is passed as a parameter
2) Write code for prefix sum of a array again array is given in the function and you have to return a array only but a prefix Sum array
3) prime numbers both approaches 
4) you are given a = int value , b = int val and c = int val , You have to check whether these 3 numbers result to Pythgoreos theorem or not h2 = b2 + l2
5) arm strong number
